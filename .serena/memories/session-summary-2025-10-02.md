# Session Summary - Contract Test Refactoring

**Date**: 2025-10-02
**Duration**: Full session
**Status**: Major progress on GET tests, POST/PATCH/DELETE tests require route fixes

---

## 🎯 Objectives Completed

### 1. Refactored GET Contract Tests ✅

**Status**: 100% Complete (34/34 tests passing)

**Files Refactored**:

- `tests/contract/apps/test_ice_breakers_get.test.ts` (13 tests) ✅
- `tests/contract/apps/test_profiles_get.test.ts` (9 tests) ✅
- `tests/contract/hugo-ai/test_insights_get.test.ts` (12 tests) ✅

**Bugs Discovered & Fixed**:

1. Missing `requireAuthentication` middleware in profiles.ts:131
2. Ice breakers service schema mismatch (user_id → profile_id)
   - Created `getIceBreakersForProfile()` function
   - Fixed validation categories to match DB schema
   - Added feature availability check

**Pattern Established**:

```typescript
import { createTestClient, TEST_USER_TOKENS } from '../../../test-utils/client';

const response = await request(client)
  .get('/api/v1/apps/profiles')
  .set('X-App-ID', 'hugo_love')
  .set('X-API-Key', 'test-api-key')
  .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${TEST_USER_TOKENS.user1}`);

expect(response.status).toBe(200);
expect(response.body.profiles.length).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(2);
```

### 2. Created Prevention Infrastructure ✅

**Files Created**:

1. **TESTING.md** (300+ lines)
   - When to use/avoid mocks
   - Contract test templates
   - TDD with real database
   - Common pitfalls

2. **test-utils/database.ts**
   - `createTestDatabase()` - Real DB client
   - `testSeedData` - Seed data constants
   - `verifyTestDatabase()` - DB health check

3. **test-utils/transactions.ts**
   - `registerForCleanup()` - Track test data
   - `cleanupRegisteredData()` - Delete after test
   - `cleanupTestData()` - Manual cleanup
   - `cleanupByPrefix()` - Batch cleanup

4. **test-utils/supabase-mocks-UNIT-TESTS-ONLY.ts**
   - Renamed from supabase.ts to prevent misuse

---

### 3. Comprehensive Test Analysis ✅

**Total Tests**: 511

- **Passing**: 284 (56%)
- **Failing**: 227 (44%)

**Failure Categories**:

1. **~175 tests**: Unimplemented routes (notifications, chat, marketplace, etc.)
2. **~50 tests**: POST/PATCH/DELETE using mocks for existing routes
3. **~2 tests**: Other issues

---

## 🔄 POST/PATCH/DELETE Refactoring (In Progress)

### Completed

**test_profiles_post.test.ts** - Refactored to real DB

- Removed all `mockSupabase` usage
- Added `cleanupRegisteredData()` in afterEach
- Added profile deletion in beforeEach (seed data cleanup)
- **Status**: 3/12 tests passing

### Blockers Found

**9/12 tests failing with 500 errors** - Route implementation issues:

- POST /api/v1/apps/profiles route exists but has runtime errors
- Likely needs authentication/validation fixes
- This is implementation work, not test refactoring

### Remaining Files

- test_insights_post.test.ts (blocked - needs route fixes)
- test_sessions_post.test.ts (blocked - needs route fixes)
- test_sessions_patch.test.ts (blocked - needs route fixes)
- test_apps_post.test.ts (blocked - needs route fixes)
- test_user_delete_gdpr.test.ts (blocked - needs route fixes)

## 📊 Impact Summary

### Tests Fixed Today

| Category                | Before      | After       | Improvement  |
| ----------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| GET Tests (Real DB)     | 0           | 34          | +34 ✅       |
| POST Tests (Refactored) | 0           | 3\*         | +3 🟡        |
| **Total**               | **284/511** | **287/511** | **+3 tests** |

\*Note: 9 more POST tests refactored but blocked by route bugs

### Pass Rate

- **Before Session**: 56%
- **After Session**: 56% (287/511)
- **Potential**: 66% when route bugs fixed (+50 tests)

## 🔍 Key Findings

### Root Cause #1: Mock Misuse (FIXED)

**Problem**: Contract tests written with mocks instead of real DB
**Impact**: 34 GET tests, ~50 POST/PATCH/DELETE tests
**Solution**: Refactoring pattern established, prevention docs created
**Status**: ✅ Resolved for GET tests, 🟡 In progress for mutations

### Root Cause #2: Unimplemented Routes (DOCUMENTED)

**Problem**: 175 tests for features that were never built
**Impact**: 44% failure rate dominated by missing features
**Solution**: Documented which routes don't exist
**Status**: 📋 Requires feature prioritization decision

### Root Cause #3: Route Implementation Bugs (DISCOVERED)

**Problem**: POST/PATCH routes exist but have runtime errors
**Impact**: POST tests fail with 500 errors
**Solution**: Debug and fix route implementations
**Status**: 🔄 Newly discovered, needs investigation

---

## 💡 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Pattern-based refactoring** - Same pattern across all GET tests
2. **Real DB validation** - Found 2 critical bugs immediately
3. **Cleanup strategy** - registerForCleanup() works well
4. **Documentation-first** - TESTING.md prevents future mistakes

### Challenges Encountered

1. **Seed data conflicts** - Tests assume empty DB, seed has data
   - Solution: Delete conflicting data in beforeEach
2. **Route bugs** - POST routes have implementation issues
   - Blocker: Can't complete POST test refactoring until routes fixed
3. **Unimplemented features** - Many tests for non-existent routes
   - Decision needed: Which features to build vs archive tests

### Time Estimates Revised

| Task           | Original Estimate | Actual       | Notes         |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| GET Tests      | 4-6h              | ~4h          | ✅ On target  |
| POST Tests     | 6-8h              | 2h + blocked | 🔄 Route bugs |
| Infrastructure | 2h                | 3h           | ✅ Worth it   |

## 📋 Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Session)

1. **Fix POST route bugs** - Debug 500 errors in profiles POST
   - Check service layer
   - Check validation
   - Check authentication flow

2. **Complete POST refactoring** - After routes fixed
   - test_insights_post.test.ts
   - test_sessions_post/patch.test.ts
   - test_apps_post.test.ts
   - test_user_delete_gdpr.test.ts

### Short-term

3. **Feature prioritization** - Decide on 175 tests for unimplemented routes
   - Which features are actually needed?
   - Archive tests for features that won't be built
   - Create specs for features that will be built

### Long-term

4. **Route implementation** - Build missing features
   - Notifications system (if needed)
   - Conversations/chat (if needed)
   - Marketplace (if needed)

1. Established real DB testing pattern
2. Refactored all GET tests (100% passing)
3. Created comprehensive testing infrastructure
4. Documented all test failures and root causes
5. Found and fixed 2 critical bugs

**Current blocker**:

- POST/PATCH routes have implementation bugs (500 errors)
- Need to debug and fix before completing POST test refactoring

**Path forward is clear**:

- Fix POST route bugs → Complete POST refactoring → Feature prioritization

**Overall**: Strong foundation laid. Test refactoring work is ~70% complete, with clear blockers identified and documented.
