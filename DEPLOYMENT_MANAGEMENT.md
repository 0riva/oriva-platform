# Deployment Management Guide

## Overview
This guide covers best practices for deploying API changes to prevent caching and deployment issues that can cause endpoints to return incorrect data or fail unexpectedly.

## Common Deployment Issues

### Edge Function Caching Problems
Vercel's edge functions cache code at multiple levels, which can cause:
- Live API running outdated cached versions
- Endpoints returning empty data despite correct code
- Inconsistent behavior between local and production environments

### Rapid Push Conflicts
Making multiple commits and pushes in quick succession can cause:
- Deployment conflicts between rapid pushes
- Intermediate versions being cached
- Incomplete deployments to edge locations

## Best Practices

### 1. Avoid Rapid Pushes
- **Wait for deployments to complete** before making new changes
- Check Vercel dashboard to ensure previous deployment is fully deployed
- Use meaningful commit messages to track changes
- Batch related changes into single commits when possible

### 2. Force Cache Refresh
- Use Vercel's **"Redeploy"** feature to force a fresh deployment
- Access via: Vercel Dashboard → Project → Deployments → Click "..." → Redeploy
- This bypasses build cache and ensures latest code is deployed
- Use when you suspect caching issues

### 3. Check Deployment Status
- **Monitor Vercel's deployment logs** to ensure changes are live
- Access via: Vercel Dashboard → Project → Deployments → Click deployment
- Verify deployment status shows "Ready" or "Completed"
- Check function logs for any errors or warnings

### 4. Testing Strategy
- **Test locally first** to ensure code works correctly
- Use staging environment for integration testing
- Test live API endpoints after deployment
- Verify database queries work with actual data

### 5. Environment Management
- Ensure environment variables are properly set in Vercel
- Check that all required dependencies are in `package.json`
- Verify database connections are working
- Test with both API keys and Supabase JWT tokens

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying API changes:

- [ ] Code tested locally and working
- [ ] All dependencies added to `package.json`
- [ ] Environment variables configured in Vercel
- [ ] Database queries tested with real data
- [ ] Authentication methods verified
- [ ] No rapid pushes in progress
- [ ] Previous deployment completed successfully

After deployment:

- [ ] Check Vercel deployment status
- [ ] Test live API endpoints
- [ ] Verify database connections
- [ ] Check function logs for errors
- [ ] Test with different authentication methods
- [ ] Monitor for any caching issues

## Troubleshooting

### Empty Data Despite Correct Code
1. Check if previous deployment completed
2. Force redeploy using Vercel dashboard
3. Wait 5-10 minutes for edge cache to refresh
4. Test with different API keys/tokens
5. Check Vercel function logs

### 404 Errors on New Endpoints
1. Verify endpoint is properly defined in code
2. Check Vercel routing configuration
3. Ensure no catch-all routes are blocking new endpoints
4. Force redeploy to clear routing cache

### Authentication Issues
1. Verify environment variables are set
2. Check API key validation logic
3. Test with both API keys and Supabase tokens
4. Review authentication middleware logs

### Database Connection Issues
1. Verify Supabase credentials in Vercel
2. Check database table names and schemas
3. Test foreign key relationships
4. Review query syntax and JOIN logic

## Monitoring

### Vercel Dashboard
- Monitor deployment status and logs
- Check function execution times
- Review error rates and patterns
- Track environment variable changes

### API Testing
- Regular endpoint health checks
- Authentication flow testing
- Database query validation
- Performance monitoring

## Emergency Procedures

### If API is Completely Down
1. Check Vercel dashboard for deployment status
2. Review function logs for errors
3. Verify environment variables
4. Force redeploy if necessary
5. Rollback to previous working version if needed

### If Endpoints Return Wrong Data
1. Check if code changes are actually deployed
2. Force cache refresh with redeploy
3. Verify database queries are correct
4. Test with different authentication methods
5. Check for RLS policy issues

## Contact Information

For deployment issues:
- Check Vercel dashboard first
- Review this documentation
- Test locally before reporting issues
- Provide specific error messages and logs
