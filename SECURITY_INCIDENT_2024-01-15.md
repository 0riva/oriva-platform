# Security Incident Report - Hardcoded Credentials Exposure

**Date**: January 15, 2024
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Status**: RESOLVED
**Reporter**: Claude Code Security Review

## Summary

Two debug files containing hardcoded Supabase production credentials were detected in the repository. These files exposed service role keys that provide unrestricted database access.

## Affected Files

- `api/debug-marketplace-data.js` (REMOVED)
- `api/debug-users.js` (REMOVED)

## Vulnerability Details

### 1. Hardcoded Production Credentials
- **Service Role Key**: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImNiemd2bGtpemtkZmptYnJvc2F2Iiwicm9sZSI6InNlcnZpY2Vfcm9sZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NDQ1ODUxNCwiZXhwIjoyMDcwMDM0NTE0fQ.FuiwIo6-CxQSAOwEobWuz_MqDtpYG4tMVFTQsWJeqYk`
- **Database URL**: `https://cbzgvlkizkdfjmbrosav.supabase.co`
- **Impact**: Full database read/write access, Row Level Security bypass

### 2. Unauthorized Database Operations
- Functions that automatically create test data in production tables
- No environment guards preventing production execution
- Potential for data corruption and unauthorized installations

## Impact Assessment

- **Confidentiality**: HIGH - Full database access could expose all user data
- **Integrity**: HIGH - Ability to modify or delete production data
- **Availability**: MEDIUM - Service role could disrupt operations

## Immediate Actions Taken

‚úÖ **Files Removed**: Both debug files deleted from filesystem
‚úÖ **Codebase Scan**: Verified no other hardcoded secrets present
‚úÖ **Security Controls**: Added pre-commit hooks for secret detection
‚úÖ **Prevention**: Updated .gitignore to prevent future debug file commits

## Recommended Follow-Up Actions

üîÑ **CRITICAL - Credential Rotation**:
- [ ] Rotate the exposed Supabase service role key immediately
- [ ] Generate new service role key in Supabase dashboard
- [ ] Update production environment variables with new key

üîÑ **Security Monitoring**:
- [ ] Review Supabase audit logs for any unauthorized access
- [ ] Monitor database activity for unusual patterns
- [ ] Check for any unauthorized data modifications

üîÑ **Team Communication**:
- [ ] Notify development team of credential exposure
- [ ] Remind team of secure coding practices
- [ ] Review and update security guidelines

## Prevention Measures Implemented

1. **Pre-commit Hooks**: `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with secret detection
2. **Baseline Configuration**: `.secrets.baseline` for ongoing monitoring
3. **Gitignore Updates**: Prevent debug files from being committed
4. **Custom Security Checks**: Specific checks for Supabase credentials

## Lessons Learned

1. Debug scripts should never contain production credentials
2. All credentials must use environment variables
3. Automated security scanning prevents credential exposure
4. Regular security reviews are essential for early detection

## Security Controls Status

- ‚úÖ Pre-commit hooks configured
- ‚úÖ Secret detection baseline established
- ‚úÖ Debug file patterns added to .gitignore
- ‚úÖ Vulnerable files removed from repository
- ‚è≥ Credential rotation (requires manual action)
