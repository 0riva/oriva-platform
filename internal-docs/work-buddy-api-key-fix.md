# Work Buddy API Key Issue - SOLVED

## 🔍 **Root Cause Found**

**Recent Change**: Commit `0c66173` - "Replace all mock data with real Supabase database queries"

### What Happened:
1. **Before**: API used MOCK data, API keys weren't validated against database
2. **After**: API now requires REAL database queries and proper API key storage
3. **Work Buddy's key**: Created when using mock data, might not be in database

## 🛠️ **Solution Options**

### Option 1: Re-generate API Key (Recommended)
Work Buddy should generate a NEW API key through the proper flow:

1. Go to Oriva Developer Settings
2. Click "Generate Live API Key"
3. Use the new key (format: `oriva_pk_live_...`)

### Option 2: Database Insert (If needed)
If the key should exist but database is missing it, we need to insert it manually in Supabase.

## 🧪 **Testing Steps**

1. **Test Health Endpoint** (should work without auth):
   ```bash
   curl https://api.oriva.io/api/v1/health
   ```

2. **Test Debug Endpoint** (shows if key is in database):
   ```bash
   curl https://api.oriva.io/api/v1/debug/workbuddy
   ```

3. **Test Profile Endpoint** (the real test):
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer WORK_BUDDY_KEY" \
     https://api.oriva.io/api/v1/profiles/available
   ```

## 📋 **For Work Buddy Team**

**Quick Fix**: Generate a new API key in Developer Settings and update your environment variables.

**The endpoints ARE working** - the issue is just that your API key needs to be re-generated after we switched from mock to real database validation.

## 🔍 **Verification**

The debug endpoint at `/api/v1/debug/workbuddy` will show:
- ✅ Key hashing works
- ✅ Database connection works
- ❌ Key not found in database (likely issue)

This confirms that the API is working but the specific API key needs to be properly registered in the database.
