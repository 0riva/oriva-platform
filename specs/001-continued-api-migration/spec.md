# Feature Specification: Continued API Migration

**Feature Branch**: `001-continued-api-migration`
**Created**: 2025-01-21
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Continued API Migration"

---

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the Oriva Platform API, I want to continue the TypeScript migration from Phase 1 to Phase 2, so that the API codebase becomes fully type-safe, maintainable, and leverages TypeScript's development benefits while maintaining 100% backward compatibility and zero regression.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** Phase 1 TypeScript infrastructure is complete, **When** Phase 2 migration is executed, **Then** the API runs entirely in TypeScript with strict type checking enabled
2. **Given** existing JavaScript API functionality, **When** TypeScript migration is completed, **Then** all 146 tests continue to pass with zero functional regression
3. **Given** current development workflow using JavaScript, **When** TypeScript migration is complete, **Then** developers can use TypeScript-first development with enhanced IDE support and compile-time error detection

### Edge Cases
- What happens when TypeScript strict mode reveals existing type inconsistencies?
- How does the system handle migration of complex Express middleware with dynamic typing?
- What is the rollback procedure if TypeScript migration causes performance issues?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST migrate all JavaScript API code to TypeScript while maintaining identical functionality
- **FR-002**: System MUST implement strict type checking without breaking existing API contracts
- **FR-003**: System MUST create comprehensive type definitions for all API interfaces, database models, and middleware
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain all 146 existing tests passing during and after migration
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide type-safe development workflow with enhanced IDE integration
- **FR-006**: System MUST implement typed error handling and response interfaces
- **FR-007**: System MUST create development documentation for TypeScript usage patterns

### Key Entities
- **API Endpoints**: TypeScript interfaces for request/response contracts
- **Database Models**: Type definitions for Supabase data structures
- **Middleware Functions**: Typed Express middleware with proper request/response typing
- **Error Responses**: Structured error interfaces with compile-time validation
- **Authentication Types**: API key and user authentication type definitions
