## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

**As a Work Buddy user**, when I receive a session reminder notification in the Work Buddy app and I dismiss it, I expect that notification to also disappear from my Oriva Core notification center, so I don't see duplicate notifications and have a consistent experience across all my Oriva apps.

**As an Oriva Core user**, I want to see all notifications from all my installed Oriva apps in one centralized notification center within Oriva Core, so I can manage all my app notifications in one place without switching between apps.

**As a third-party app developer**, I want to publish notifications to the Oriva platform so my users can see them in Oriva Core, and I want to be notified when users interact with my notifications (dismiss, click) so I can keep my app's state synchronized.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Third-Party App Creates Notification
1. **Given** Work Buddy has an upcoming session for user Sarah
2. **When** Work Buddy creates a session reminder notification 10 minutes before the session
3. **Then** the notification appears in Work Buddy's local notification list
4. **And** the notification is sent to Oriva platform
5. **And** the notification appears in Sarah's Oriva Core notification center
6. **And** the notification shows Work Buddy's app icon and branding

#### Scenario 2: User Dismisses Notification in Oriva Core
1. **Given** Sarah has a Work Buddy notification visible in Oriva Core
2. **When** Sarah swipes to dismiss the notification in Oriva Core
3. **Then** the notification is marked as dismissed on Oriva platform
4. **And** Work Buddy is notified of the dismissal
5. **And** the notification is removed from Work Buddy's notification list
6. **And** the notification no longer appears in any of Sarah's devices

#### Scenario 3: User Dismisses Notification in Third-Party App
1. **Given** Sarah has a Work Buddy notification visible in both Work Buddy and Oriva Core
2. **When** Sarah dismisses the notification in the Work Buddy app
3. **Then** the notification is marked as dismissed on Oriva platform
4. **And** Oriva Core is notified of the dismissal
5. **And** the notification is removed from Oriva Core's notification center
6. **And** no duplicate dismissal happens

#### Scenario 4: User Clicks Notification Action
1. **Given** Sarah has a session reminder notification in Oriva Core with a "View Session" button
2. **When** Sarah clicks the "View Session" button
3. **Then** the notification is marked as clicked on Oriva platform
4. **And** Sarah is deep-linked to the session details in Work Buddy app
5. **And** Work Buddy is notified that the notification was clicked
6. **And** Work Buddy can track engagement metrics

#### Scenario 5: Multiple Apps Send Notifications
1. **Given** Sarah uses Work Buddy, Hugo AI, and two other Oriva apps
2. **When** each app sends notifications throughout the day
3. **Then** all notifications appear in Oriva Core's unified notification center
4. **And** notifications are grouped or sorted by app
5. **And** Sarah can filter notifications by app
6. **And** each notification shows the source app's icon and name

#### Scenario 6: App Subscribes to Platform Events
1. **Given** Work Buddy wants to know when users interact with its notifications
2. **When** Work Buddy subscribes to notification.dismissed and notification.clicked events
3. **Then** Work Buddy receives webhook callbacks whenever these events occur
4. **And** the webhook payload contains the notification details and user action
5. **And** Work Buddy can update its internal state based on the events

#### Scenario 7: Real-Time Notification Updates
1. **Given** Sarah has Oriva Core open on her phone and tablet
2. **When** a new notification is created by Work Buddy
3. **Then** the notification appears on both devices in real-time without refresh
4. **And** when Sarah dismisses on her phone, it disappears from tablet immediately
5. **And** the experience feels seamless across devices

#### Scenario 8: Notification Expiry
1. **Given** Work Buddy creates a session reminder with 2-hour expiry
2. **When** 2 hours pass without user interaction
3. **Then** the notification is automatically removed from all notification centers
4. **And** the notification state is marked as expired
5. **And** users no longer see outdated notifications

### Edge Cases

#### Data Integrity
- What happens when a third-party app creates a notification but Oriva platform is temporarily unavailable?
  - App should queue the notification locally and retry with exponential backoff
  - User should still see notification in the app
  - Once platform is available, notification syncs to Oriva Core

- What happens when a user dismisses a notification offline?
  - Dismissal should be queued locally
  - When device comes online, dismissal syncs to platform
  - Platform broadcasts dismissal to all apps
  - No duplicate dismissals occur

#### Webhook Failures
- What happens when a webhook endpoint is unavailable?
  - Platform retries webhook delivery with exponential backoff
  - After max retries, webhook is marked as failed
  - App developer receives alert about webhook failures
  - Failed deliveries are logged for debugging

- What happens when a webhook endpoint is consistently failing?
  - After 100 consecutive failures, webhook is automatically disabled
  - App developer receives notification about disabled webhook
  - Developer can re-enable webhook after fixing their endpoint

#### State Conflicts
- What happens when a notification is dismissed in two apps simultaneously?
  - Platform uses timestamp-based conflict resolution
  - First dismissal wins
  - Second dismissal is acknowledged but doesn't change state
  - No error is shown to users

- What happens when a notification expires while user is dismissing it?
  - Both expiry and dismissal are valid state transitions
  - Dismissal takes precedence (more explicit user action)
  - Notification state is marked as dismissed, not expired

#### Security & Privacy
- What happens when an app tries to create notifications for users who haven't installed it?
  - Platform rejects the notification creation
  - Error is returned to the app
  - Security audit log captures the attempt

- What happens when an app tries to access notifications from other apps?
  - Platform enforces app-level data isolation
  - Apps can only query their own notifications
  - Users in Oriva Core can see all their notifications from all apps

#### Scale & Performance
- What happens when a popular app sends 10,000 notifications simultaneously?
  - Platform queues notifications for processing
  - Notifications are created in batches
  - Users receive notifications within acceptable latency (< 5 seconds)
  - No system overload occurs

- What happens when a user has 1,000+ unread notifications?
  - Notification queries use pagination
  - UI shows most recent notifications first
  - Older notifications can be loaded on demand
  - Performance remains acceptable

#### Notification Content
- What happens when a notification contains malicious content (XSS)?
  - Platform sanitizes all notification content
  - Scripts and malicious HTML are stripped
  - Safe content is displayed to users
  - Security team is alerted

- What happens when a notification has a broken deep link?
  - Notification still displays in Oriva Core
  - When user clicks, error message shows
  - User can still dismiss the notification
  - App receives click event for tracking

## Notes

### Business Value
This feature enables Oriva to provide a unified notification experience across its entire app ecosystem, similar to how iOS or Android provides a centralized notification center. Users benefit from consistency, developers benefit from built-in notification infrastructure, and Oriva strengthens its platform ecosystem.

### Key Success Factors
1. **Cross-app consistency**: Dismissing in one place dismisses everywhere
2. **Real-time synchronization**: Updates feel instant across devices
3. **Developer adoption**: Easy for third-party apps to integrate
4. **Scalability**: System handles growth in apps and users
5. **Reliability**: Notifications never get lost or duplicated

### Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)
- Rich notification templates (images, videos, interactive elements)
- Notification grouping/threading by conversation
- Smart notification scheduling based on user behavior
- Push notification delivery to mobile devices (separate feature)
- Notification preferences and do-not-disturb modes
