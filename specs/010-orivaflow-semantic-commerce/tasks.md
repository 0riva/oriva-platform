## Dependencies

**Phase 1 → Phase 2**: Database schema required before service layer
**Phase 2 → Phase 3**: Marketplace items must exist before payment integration
**Phase 3 → Phase 4**: Payment system required before earner-specific flows
**Phase 4 → Phase 5/6**: Earner types must exist before affiliate/advertising networks
**Phase 5/6 → Phase 7**: Affiliate/Ad systems required before semantic suggestions
**Phase 7 → Phase 8**: Semantic intelligence required before contextual UX
**Phase 8 → Phase 9**: Commerce UX required before comprehensive analytics

**Critical Path**: T001-T029 (Database) → T030-T065 (Marketplace) → T066-T099 (Payments) → T127-T148 (Affiliate) → T187-T198 (Contextual UX)

## Constitutional Compliance Summary

**✅ Extends Existing Systems (60% Reuse)**:
- MarketplaceItemCard extends EntryCard (T056-T057)
- Marketplace categories use Collections (T035-T036)
- Escrow extends Agreement system (T073-T074, T126)
- SemanticCommerceService wraps HugoAIService (T175-T176)
- Contextual suggestions embed in threads (T187-T188)
- Feed integration enhances existing Feed component (T192)

**New Domain-Specific Components (40%)**:
- Payment processing (Stripe Connect, OrivaPay)
- Affiliate network (URL shortening, commission tracking)
- Advertising network (targeting, serving, analytics)
- 6 earner type systems (Creator, Vendor, Developer, Advertiser, Affiliate, Influencer)

**Reuse Rate**: 60% existing systems + 40% new marketplace domain = ✅ **CONSTITUTIONAL COMPLIANCE PASSED**

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

### Smart Agreement Intelligence (v2)
- **FUTURE-001**: Implement agreement template recommendation engine (FR-030)
- **FUTURE-002**: Build clause suggestion system based on historical data (FR-031)
- **FUTURE-003**: Create risk detection model from dispute patterns (FR-032)
- **FUTURE-004**: Develop agreement outcome tracking and learning system (FR-033)

**Prerequisites**: 6+ months of agreement data collection, Hugo AI training on agreement corpus

**Rationale**: Advanced AI features require historical data corpus that won't exist at MVP launch. Deferred to v2 after sufficient data collection period.
